<h1 class='title'>Taxonomy of Data Gaps (<a href='/'>Back</a>)</h1>

<div class='content'>
  <p>
  Data gaps are classified within six categories: Wish, Obtainability, Usability, Reliability, Sufficiency, and Miscellaneous/Other.

      <ul>
        <li>Dataset is not Accessible according to <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR Principles</a> (“once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation”).</li>

      <ul>

    <li><b>U4: Documentation</b> - <i>Documentation on data usage requires improvement.</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Documentation or other types of metadata required to help users understand how to use the data are incomplete, lacking in detail, or unclear (see also <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR Principles</a> R1 and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010" target="_blank">Datasheets for Datasets</a>).</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>U5: Pre-processing</b> - <i>Data needs to be processed or cleaned prior to analysis.</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Data contains an excessive amount of missing values, noise, and duplicates that need to be cleaned.</li>
        <li>Data needs to be annotated.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>U6: Large Volume</b> - <i>Usability is impeded by large data volume.</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Dataset requires significant computational resources to process, presenting challenges for users who lack sufficient computing power.</li>
        <li>Dataset is too large to easily be downloaded and transferred to computing infrastructure that is not already co-located with the dataset.</li>
        <li>Data provider is unable to store or host the dataset effectively due to insufficient storage space.</li>
        <li>Dataset is not partitioned or searchable, requiring bulk download with significant computational resources.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  &#8227;<b>Type R: Reliability</b> - <i>Data needs to be improved, validated, and/or verified.</i>

    <li><b>R1: Quality</b> - <i>Data quality needs to be improved, validated, and/or verified.</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Data may contain significant errors or inaccuracies.</li>
        <li>Data needs to be “ground truthed” or otherwise validated/verified.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>R2: Provenance</b> - <i>Data integrity needs to be validated/verified due to provenance.</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Data provenance is not properly documented (see also <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR Principles</a> R1.2 and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010" target="_blank">Datasheets for Datasets</a>).</li>
        <li>Integrity of data needs to be validated/verified by a trustworthy source due to provenance-related issues (e.g., data is self-reported or comes from an unverified source).</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  &#8227;<b>Type S: Sufficiency</b> - <i>Data is insufficient and needs to be collected or simulated.</i>

      <ul>
        <li>Amount of data is insufficient for intended machine learning tasks.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Data is only available for certain regions, time periods, demographic groups, etc., thereby limiting its usefulness.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>S3: Granularity</b> - <i>Data is lacking in granularity/resolution.</i></li>

      <ul>
        <li>Data is not released promptly or is otherwise out of date.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>S5: Proxy</b> - <i>Data needs to be inferred or simulated.</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Ground truth data is difficult or impossible to collect, and instead needs to be inferred or simulated.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>S6: Missing Components</b> - <i>Dataset is missing important variables or types of information.</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Dataset is missing additional variables or types of information that are important for downstream analysis (e.g., because this information has not yet been collected).</li>

  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  &#8227;<b>Type M: Miscellaneous/Other</b> - <i>Challenges or gaps that do not fit into the other categories, including challenges that arise from the use of multiple datasets.</i>
